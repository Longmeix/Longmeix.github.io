## About Meixiu Long (龙玫秀)
I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.sysu.edu.cn/"> Sun Yat-sen Univerisity</a> (SYSU), excepted to graduate in 2026, working under the mentorship of [Prof. Jiahai Wang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2551). Before this, I received my B.Eng. Degree from [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) in June 2021.

My research lies at the intersection of **graph representation learning** and **data mining** -- with a special focus on network alignment for information fusion. 
Meanwhile, I am interested in **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, **meta-learning**, **out-of-distribution generalization on graphs**, **explainability in GNNs**.

Outside of academia, I like dancing, music and calligraphy.

<!-- ## Research Interests
